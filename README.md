# ATM-Python-
You must write a Python program that validates an ATM PIN while handling errors  gracefully. Your program should meet the following requirements: 

Requirements 
1. Input Handling 
• Prompt the user to enter their 4-digit ATM PIN. 
• Ensure the input is exactly 4 digits long. 
• If the input is too short or too long, show an error message. 
2. Error Handling 
• If the user enters non-numeric characters (letters, spaces, special characters), 
display an appropriate error message. 
• If the user enters an invalid PIN, allow them to try again. 
• Do not let the program crash under any circumstances. 
3. Lockout Mechanism 
• The user has 3 attempts to enter the correct PIN. 
• After 3 failed attempts, the system should lock the user out and display a message. 
• The system should pause for 10 seconds before allowing another attempt. 
4. Security Enhancements 
• Ensure the PIN is visible while typing (no hidden input). 
• Store the correct PIN securely within the program (hardcoded for now) 
Submission Guidelines 
• Submit your Python script (.py file),name your file using your initials and student 
number (e.g., JS_123456).  
• Ensure your code is well-commented to explain your logic. 
• Test your program to confirm it meets all the requirements.
